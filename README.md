## <a name="introduction">🤖 Introduction </a>
The primary goal of the project is to create two distinct vectors for recommendation purposes: a 'parameter vector' for each user that is intended to capture their movie tastes, and a feature vector of the same size for each movie that provides a description of the movie.
<br/>
The design of this system is centered around using these vectors to estimate a user's potential rating for a movie; specifically, the dot product of the user's parameter vector and the movie's feature vector, along with a bias term, is intended to produce an estimate of the rating the user might give to that particular movie.
